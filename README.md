Cisco Virtual Internship Projects:


Topology-1:
The objective is to establish a connection between multiple computers using a switch and assign unique IP addresses to each computer.
This involves performing "ping" tests between neighboring computers to verify connectivity. Also, explore the MAC table in the switch and
understand its fundamental functionalities such as learning, flooding, and forwarding. Furthermore, experiment with basic configuration
and view commands on the switch to familiarize ourselves with its operation.
